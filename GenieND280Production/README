Genie ND280 Monte Carlo Production Suite
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------// 

These scripts provide the machinery to set up and run Monte Carlo production
jobs for T2K's ND280 based upon GENIE input neutrino vector files. The file
'RunInfo.card' is used to set the important fields (which nd280 software
version, which production run and *shudder* respin, etc...).

The CreateDirs.py script sets up the directory structure and makes symbolic
links for each of the separate beamline / beam / geometry configurations. 

The MCConfigClass, MCRunInfoClass, and MCJobClass files provide the class
structure for setting up the correct parameters for the input macro files and
job submission scripts.

CreateCfgFile.py and SubmitJob.py do pretty much what you'd expect from the
names...

WhatIsMissing.py queries the output file directories and finds missing files
(each job has a final output of 6 files, each one the output of a single stage
and of the job and all but the last acts as an input to the next stage).
Also, checksize.py is useful for finding abnormal file sizes.

Purge.py is useful for wiping out all of the output for a given subrun
(it's a good idea to do just start over from the beginning for
a given subrun if a job hiccups at any point). 

GridPush.py pushes the output files to the TRIUMF SRM server using gridtools.
