Some python scripts to query the nd280 bugzilla site for reconstruction-specific
bugs. The tables that bugzilla provides are a bit limited in scope for what we
want.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------// 
GatherBugs.py 
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------// 
Assuming that the cookies.txt file is valid (after logging into the
bugzilla.nd280.org site, export the cookie into a text file), this script will
first grab (using curl) the bugzilla page using a search query for all recon
bugs. It then parses the page and splits the bugs into a list and sorts by
severity status of the bug. 

It then queries each bug's page, i.e.
https://bugzilla.nd280.org/show_bug.cgi?id=666 

This unfortunately takes a while because it's an individual curl call for each
bug, and the nd280.org site at TRIUMF is stupid slow on the best of days. But
the individual bug's page is the only place to get the history information for
that bug.

Finally, it pickles all the info up for use by...

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------// 
TableByPackage.py
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------// 

This script reads in the saved pickle file with all the bug info and outputs
HTML for input into the t2k.org reconstruction site.
